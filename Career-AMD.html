            <p>
                Su joined AMD in January 2012 as Senior VP and General Manager. Between 2012 and 2014, Su helped AMD
                to diversify its markets by pursuing chip contracts with Sony and Microsoft to use AMD chipsets in 
                their Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles respectively. In October 2014, Dr. Su was appointed CEO and
                President of AMD tasked with the mission of turning the company around and seeking new channels of growth.

                In 2015 Dr. Su and executive members of AMD planned their comeback strategy and restructured AMD into 
                three divisions each focused on a different aspect of AMD&apos;s product portfolio: The CPU division, the Graphics division,
                and Semi-Custom Solutions division. Each division tasked with growing AMD&apos;s market share in three distinct markets: 
                Gaming, Data Centers, and Immersive Platforms. By February 2017, Su oversaw the launch of AMD&apos;s new Zen 
                microarchitecture based on a 14nm FinFET technology and had a 40% IPC increase over the previous Excavator architecture. 
                The Zen architecture became a viable competitor to Intel&apos;s offering in the desktop and datacenter market and with the 
                chiplet design provided better fabrication and scaling of products. By the end of Q1 2022 AMD&apos;s CPU market share 
                grew to 27.7% up from less than 10% in 2016. Under Dr. Su&apos;s leadership AMD has grown its annual revenue from a low
                of $3.9 billion to over $16.4 billion.
