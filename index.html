                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Lisa Su first immigrated to the United States at 3 years old with her parents and siblings. 
                        Her father was a statistician, and her mother was an accountant and entrepreneur that emphasized
                        learning mathematics and business acumen at an early age. She had a natural aptitude towards 
                        electronics and mechanics at the age of 10. Often working on her brothers remote control cars by  
                        taking them apart and putting them back together. She attended MIT in 1986 and graduated in 1994 
                        with her PhD in Electrical Engineering.

                <h2>Career</h2>        
                    <h2 id="ibm">Texas Instruments &AMP; IBM &lpar;1994-2007&rpar;</h2>
                    <p>
                        She started her career in June 1994 at Texas Instruments working as part of the Semiconductor 
                        Process and Device Center but by February 1995 was hired by IBM to work in its device physics 
                        research department. She became VP of IBM&apos;s Semiconductor Research and Development and was 
                        instrumental in the development of using copper connections in semiconductors. By the year 2000, 
                        Su was assigned to head a new division at IBM called the Emerging Products Division and working 
                        in partnership with Sony and Toshiba in the development of next-generation microprocessors. 
                        As part of that partnership, she collaborated with Ken Kutaragi in the development of the Cell 
                        microprocessor used in Sony&apos;s PlayStation 3 console in 2006. She stayed at IBM as VP of 
                        Semiconductor Research and Development until May 2007.

                    <p>
                        In June 2007, Dr. Su joined Freescale Semiconductor as Chief Technology Officer. At Freescale she
                        continued to reprise her role leading in semiconductor research and development and became Senior
                        VP and General Manager of Freescale&apos;s networking and multimedia group. She helped organize 
                        Freescale&apos;s global strategy, marketing, and engineering and was instrumental in Freescale&apos;s 
                        IPO launch in 2011.

                    <h2>AMD &lpar;2012-Present&rpar;</h2>
                    <p>
                        Su joined AMD in January 2012 as Senior VP and General Manager. Between 2012 and 2014, Su helped AMD
                        to diversify its markets by pursuing chip contracts with Sony and Microsoft to use AMD chipsets in 
                        their Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles respectively. In October 2014, Dr. Su was appointed CEO and
                        President of AMD tasked with the mission of turning the company around and seeking new channels of growth.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2015 Dr. Su and executive members of AMD planned their comeback strategy and restructured AMD into 
                        three divisions each focused on a different aspect of AMD&apos;s product portfolio: The CPU division, the Graphics division,
                        and Semi-Custom Solutions division. Each division tasked with growing AMD&apos;s market share in three distinct markets: 
                        Gaming, Data Centers, and Immersive Platforms. By February 2017, Su oversaw the launch of AMD&apos;s new Zen 
                        microarchitecture based on a 14nm FinFET technology and had a 40% IPC increase over the previous Excavator architecture. 
                        The Zen architecture became a viable competitor to Intel&apos;s offering in the desktop and datacenter market and with the 
                        chiplet design provided better fabrication and scaling of products. By the end of Q1 2022 AMD&apos;s CPU market share 
                        grew to 27.7% up from less than 10% in 2016. Under Dr. Su&apos;s leadership AMD has grown its annual revenue from a low
                        of $3.9 billion to over $16.4 billion.
