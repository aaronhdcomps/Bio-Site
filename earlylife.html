            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Lisa Su first immigrated to the United States at 3 years old with her parents and siblings. 
                Her father was a statistician, and her mother was an accountant and entrepreneur that emphasized
                learning mathematics and business acumen at an early age. She had a natural aptitude towards 
                electronics and mechanics at the age of 10. Often working on her brothers remote control cars by  
                taking them apart and putting them back together. She attended MIT in 1986 and graduated in 1994 
                with her PhD in Electrical Engineering.
