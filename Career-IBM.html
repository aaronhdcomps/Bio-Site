                in partnership with Sony and Toshiba in the development of next-generation microprocessors. 
                As part of that partnership, she collaborated with Ken Kutaragi in the development of the Cell 
                microprocessor used in Sony&apos;s PlayStation 3 console in 2006. She stayed at IBM as VP of
